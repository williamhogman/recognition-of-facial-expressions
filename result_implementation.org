The resulting artifacts in comprised of a number of parts. These
are, the METT module, the questionnaire module, run-time
configuration, deployment scripts and text assets. These components
are replaceable with other components on an as-needed basis.

* Configuration
  The Python modules expects configuration in the JavaScript Object
  Notation (JSON). These configuration artifacts consists of three
  separate files. One with overall configuration global applicable to
  each trial and question of the experiment. The second file
  specifies paths to image files for masks and stimuli as well as
  correct responses for each individual trial of the METT
  paradigm. Finally, a third JSON file specifies the questions for
  SPEC.

* Deployment scripts
  To simplify the configuration and use of the system a number of
  utility scripts were developed, including scripts for generating
  subsets of the RaFD, starting the system in a given configuration
  state, and running a demonstration mode of the software.

* Text assets
