abstract = {Social animals including humans share a range of social mechanisms that are automatic and implicit and enable learning by observation. Learning from others includes imitation of actions and mirroring of emotions. Learning about others, such as their group membership and reputation, is crucial for social interactions that depend on trust. For accurate prediction of others' changeable dispositions, mentalizing is required, i.e., tracking of intentions, desires, and beliefs. Implicit mentalizing is present in infants less than one year old as well as in some nonhuman species. Explicit mentalizing is a meta-cognitive process and enhances the ability to learn about the world through self-monitoring and reflection, and may be uniquely human. Meta-cognitive processes can also exert control over automatic behavior, for instance, when short-term gains oppose long-term aims or when selfish and prosocial interests collide. We suggest that they also underlie the ability to explicitly share experiences with other agents, as in reflective discussion and teaching. These are key in increasing the accuracy of the models of the world that we construct.},

abstract = {Answers to the question "What are human emotions for?" have stimulated highly productive programs of research on emotional phenomena in psychology and neuroscience in the past decade. Although a variety of functions have been proposed and examined at different levels of abstraction, what is undeniable is that when emotional processing is compromised, most things social go awry. In this review we survey the research findings documenting the functions of emotion and link these to new discoveries about how emotion is accurately processed and transmitted. We focus specifically on emotion processing in dyads and groups, which reflects the current scientific trend. Within dyads, emotional expressions and learning and understanding through vicarious emotion are the phenomena of interest. Behavioral and brain mechanisms supporting their successful occurrence are evaluated. At the group level, group emotions and group-based emotions, two very different phenomena, are discussed, and mechanistic accounts are reviewed.},

Whilst that test succeeded in discriminating a group of adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) from controls, it suffered from several psychometric problems. In this paper these limitations are rectified by revising the test. The Revised Eyes Test was administered to a group of adults with AS or HFA (N = 15) and again discriminated these from a large number of normal controls (N = 239) drawn from different samples. In both the clinical and control groups the Eyes Test was inversely correlated with the Autism Spectrum Quotient (the AQ), a measure of autistic traits in adults of normal intelligence. The Revised Eyes Test has improved power to detect subtle individual differences in social sensitivity.},

abstract = {Emotional Competence (EC), which refers to individual differences in the identification, understanding, expression, regulation and use of one's own emotions and those of others, has been found to be an important predictor of individuals' adaptation to their environment. Higher EC is associated with greater happiness, better mental and physical health, more satisfying social and marital relationships and greater occupational success. While it is well-known that EC (as a whole) predicts a number of important outcomes, it is unclear so far which specific competency(ies) participate(s) in a given outcome. This is because no measure of EC distinctly measures each of the five core emotional competences, separately for one's own and others' emotions. This lack of information is problematic both theoretically (we do not understand the processes at stake) and practically (we cannot develop customized interventions). This paper aims to address this issue. We developed and validated in four steps a complete (albeit short: 50 items) self-reported measure of EC: the Profile of Emotional Competence. Analyses performed on a representative sample of 5676 subjects revealed promising psychometric properties. The internal consistency of scales and subscales alike was satisfying, factorial structure was as expected, and concurrent/discriminant validity was good.},

When responded to honestly, the EQ-i:Sis predicted by The Big Five with a multiple correlation of .79. Therefore, the EQ-i:S can be viewed as an aggregation of The Big Five constructs. When faking, respondents were able to improve scores on the EQ-i:S, each of its subtests, and each of The Big Five measures. Respondents improved scores on the EQ-i:S by .83 SD. Faking on the EQ-i:S was primarily predicted by cognitive ability and agreeableness. The relative ease with which respondents can substantially raise their scores limits the value of the EQ-i:S as an applicant screening tool. The substantial extent to which the EQ-i:S is predicted by The Big Five casts doubt on the construct of emotional intelligence as operationalized in the EQ-i:S.},

abstract = {Eighty-four tertiary students completed questionnaires measuring emotional intelligence (EI), personality, affiliation, abstract reasoning ability, emotional knowledge, and task orientation. Among personality variables, extraversion and agreeableness correlated moderately with total Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) (p<0.01), and weakly (p<0.05) with openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism. TMMS was also correlated with emotional knowledge (p<0.01) but not with abstract reasoning or interest in affiliation. Results from the same sample with the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso, Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) revealed inconsistencies between the two EI scales. Thus, openness, extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism and interest in affiliation were not significantly related to the MSCEIT, but agreeableness and emotional knowledge (p<0.01) and abstract reasoning ability (p<0.05) were. Results also found that EI as estimated by the TMMS, but not the MSCEIT, was correlated with task orientation (p<0.01); but this effect disappeared when personality was controlled for. Taken as a whole, the differential performance of the TMMS and MSCEIT supports a proposal for two distinct types of EI: trait EI and ability EI (Petrides \& Furnham, 2000).},

In the first part of the present study (N=274, 92 males), we performed two joint factor analyses to determine the location of trait EI in Eysenckian and Big Five factor space. The results showed that trait EI is a compound personality construct located at the lower levels of the two taxonomies. In the second part of the study, we performed six two-step hierarchical regressions to investigate the incremental validity of trait EI in predicting, over and above the Giant Three and Big Five personality dimensions, six distinct criteria (life satisfaction, rumination, two adaptive and two maladaptive coping styles). Trait EI incrementally predicted four criteria over the Giant Three and five criteria over the Big Five.

This study sought to further examine the constructs measured by the MSCEIT by replicating and extending their research through confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of the following models: (a) a one-factor model reflecting general emotional intelligence (EI); (b) an oblique two-factor model reflecting the Experiential and Strategic areas; (c) an oblique four-factor model reflecting the four branches or scales of the ability model; (d) an oblique three-factor model reflecting the Perceiving Emotions, Understanding Emotions, and Managing Emotions factors; (e) a general factor model with a nested orthogonal Perceiving Emotions factor and oblique Understanding Emotions and Managing Emotions factors; and (f) a hierarchical model reflecting the MSCEIT’s implied theoretical structure, with oblique first-order factors reflecting the four branches, two oblique second-order factors, and a third-order general EI factor. Results of these analyses replicate those of Gignac (2005) and Palmer et al. (2005), suggesting that the MSCEIT does not measure all the constructs intended by its authors. Further refinement of the test, underlying theory, or both, is needed, with particular emphasis on the Using Emotions factor.},

Although a variety of functions have been proposed and examined at different levels of abstraction, what is undeniable is that when emotional processing is compromised, most things social go awry. In this review we survey the research findings documenting the functions of emotion and link these to new discoveries about how emotion is accurately processed and transmitted. We focus specifically on emotion processing in dyads and groups, which reflects the current scientific trend. Within dyads, emotional expressions and learning and understanding through vicarious emotion are the phenomena of interest. Behavioral and brain mechanisms supporting their successful occurrence are evaluated. At the group level, group emotions and group-based emotions, two very different phenomena, are discussed, and mechanistic accounts are reviewed.},

In the present study (n=176), we examined the effects of these two instruction forms (TP vs. MP) on the EMA-scores in a between-subject design. In addition, the relations of typical and maximum EMA to cognitive intelligence components and personality traits were tested. Instruction-related comparisons of the EMA-scores yielded not only lower means but also higher standard deviations and higher reliabilities in the TP-condition. As expected, maximum EMA were significantly correlated with cognitive intelligence components but not with personality traits. In contrast, the typical EMA were moderately associated with personality traits but not related to cognitive abilities, providing further evidence of the importance to distinguish between typical and maximum performance.},

Still another was that during emotion body movements could be more easily suppressed than facial expression.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test is a widely used facial affect recognition test. The present study aimed to provide Swedish nonpatient reference values, examine test-retest reliability, and to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of the instrument.

METHODS: A Swedish version of the test was completed by 158 university students. Fifty-eight participants completed the test twice, 3 weeks apart. The Bland Altman method was used to examine the test-retest reliability.

RESULTS: Distribution of responses of the 158 participants is detailed and compared with the English version. The limits of agreement was +/-4.3.

CONCLUSIONS: A test score variation in the range of +/-4 (out of 24 possible) is to be expected for the same individual. When the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test is used, one has to take into account that an obtained test score must be regarded as an approximation.},
